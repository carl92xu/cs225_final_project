### Git Commands
Highly Recommand Using GitHub Desktop for all these. GitHub Desktop saves much of the pain
when you try do some Git stuff. If you want to show off, here are some helpful git command lines: 

\# *Open git manual*  
`git help`  
\# *Open git manual for a specific command on a browers*  
`git help [command]`  
\# *clone the repo into a directory named **name***  
`git clone [url] [name]`  
\# *For pushing to main*  
`git push origin main`  
\# *For pushing to other branch*  
`git push origin [your branch name]`
