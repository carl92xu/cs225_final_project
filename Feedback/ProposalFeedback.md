# Comments

I have given some minor comments for the leading question, data, and algorithms.

The major flaw is that you cannot have Dijkstra's and A* search as your 2 algorithms as they are very similar to one another. Please change one of them. (Note that landmarks algorihtm can't be an uncovered algorithm)

**Leading question:**

How will you choose the most often visited airport?

Edit the first leading question as you can't use both Dijkstra's and A* search.

What is the leading question that Dijkstra's/A* (whichever you choose) will answer? Also include a question that your last algorithm will answer.

**Dataset:** 

How big is the dataset? How much will you use?

**Algorithms:** 

Change either Dijkstra's or A* to another algorithm. Remember to keep at least 1 uncovered algorithm.
